/*
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is used for evaluating the shortest paths between vertices in a graph.

implementation will take the following steps:

1- Evaluate the distances between the starting vertex and its neighbors
2- If the new distance to the neighbor is lower than the previous distance, record it, and queue up the neighbor
3- Dequeue the next vertex to evaluate
4- Repeat steps 2 - 3 until there are no more vertices left in the queue.
